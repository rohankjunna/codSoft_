            <h4> Honeoye</h4>
            <p>
              Honeoye strawberries are day-neutral June-bearing strawberries. 
              They're large berries that range in color from bright orange-red to red.
               They're true to their name as they taste sweet, like honey.
               This type of strawberry produces a lot of berries, as it has a high yield and a long growing season.

            <h4>Allstar</h4>
            <p>
              Allstar strawberries look most like the stereotypical strawberries you’d find in a grocery store. 
              They feature a perfect strawberry shape and plump, red appearance.
               They’re large strawberries that ripen in late mid-season.
               They have a mild but sweet flavor and are resistant to disease.

            <h4> Chandler</h4>
            <p>
              Chandler strawberries are June bearers that produce very large, firm, and exceptionally tasty strawberries.
               Their glossy, red color and flavor profile are extremely desirable. However,
               the drawback of Chandler berries is that they are not very resistant to disease.

            <h4>Jewel</h4>
            <p>
              Jewel strawberries are the picture perfect strawberry.
               They’re large, red, and juicy. They have an excellent flavor and are high-quality and hearty. 
               They also have longer season yields.
